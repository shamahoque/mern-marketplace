In addition to the follow javascript files, I will look into each of the react libraries that were imported from React.

DeleteUser.js
  Relys on Component Class (React)
  This class looks convoluted with no comments.

EditProfile.js
  This file seems interesting since the CSS portion of the code is somehow manipulated from the JS.

Profile.js
  Very difficult to read javascript file, no comments and looks to be body functions nested inside params.

Signup.js
  Prior knowledge in making signup web pages, so this file was easy for me to follow along, however i'd like to take a closer look, so I can understand how it was accomplished using node and js.

StripeConnect.js
  What looks to be a hashing and salting authentication logic page, however I am not certain since there is no comments.

Users.js
  This page looks like it obtains user data from database based on input of signup or login page.

api-users.js
  This page looks like it contains DOM requests such as get/post requests in order to make rich, responsive web.
